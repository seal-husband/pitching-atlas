Data for the 3-D map: the four numbers as a composition, in log-ratio coordinates.

The four numbers (arm run, arm drop, glove sweep, glove drop; inches per pitch) are the
parts of one whole -- how a pitcher distributes the movement of everything that is not his
four-seam. Compared as a composition (Aitchison), with the partition {arm | glove}, the
three isometric log-ratio balances are

    x = ln(arm drop / arm run) / √2            + drops more than it runs
    y = ln(glove drop / glove sweep) / √2      + drops more than it sweeps
    z = ln(arm share / glove share) / √2       + throws more arm-side pitches
        share = that side's pitches ÷ all pitches (the four-seam counted in neither)

x and y are pure shape: usage cancels inside a side. z was first the ilr balance between the
sides, ln(g(arm) / g(glove)) with g the geometric mean of a side's two parts -- usage × movement.
That mixed in how far each side's pitches move from the four-seam and how balanced their two
parts are: Tim Hill, 83% arm-side, sat in the middle because his sinker moves little from the
(converted) four-seam and barely drops. z is now usage alone, as the article describes it
(2026-10-05). The two versions correlate 0.93 and neither relates to the Stuff stand-in.

All three are natural logs of ratios over √2, so the map can be drawn at one scale and
neighbours found by plain Euclidean distance. The composition's size -- how much non-four-seam
movement there is at all -- is left out on purpose, as the pitcher's plane height was: the
map describes how movement is distributed, not how much.

History of the choice (10): x, y were first angles (unstable for a side barely thrown),
then differences (stable but mixing amount into direction); z was a difference, then an
angle. Log-ratios settle it in one geometry. Their zero problem -- a side not thrown -- is
handled the standard way, a small pseudo-amount DELTA added to every part before the ratio;
split-half reliability is then 0.995 / 0.998 / 0.994, and 0.97 for pitchers with under 10%
arm-side pitches, flat for DELTA from 0.05 to 1.0.

Three views, because a pitcher's mix depends on who is batting (changeups go to the
opposite side): all batters, vs right-handed batters, vs left-handed batters. Each view is
computed from that view's pitches only; a pitcher needs MIN_VIEW pitches in it to appear.
The four-seam reference and each peak's side are the pitcher's whole-season ones in
every view.
