Where things live. Every script takes its Statcast files from here.

The season files are pitch-level Statcast data, one parquet per season, fetched with
00_fetch_statcast.py. They are not part of the repository (MLB Advanced Media's terms do
not allow redistributing them); by default they are expected in data/ next to src/, and
the environment variable PITCHING_ATLAS_DATA can point somewhere else.
