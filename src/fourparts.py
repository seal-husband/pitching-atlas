"""
The four numbers, computed one way everywhere (07 and every script after it).

For every pitch other than the four-seam, with (fx, fz) its movement from the pitcher's
four-seam (converted from his sinker or cutter if he throws none):

  side   decided per PEAK, not per pitch: a peak (05_peaks.py, found without labels)
         is glove side when its mean fx is at least GLOVE_X inches toward the glove side,
         arm side otherwise. Deciding pitch by pitch split a pitch type lying near the
         boundary in two (Tim Hill's sinker, whose four-seam sits almost on top of it).
         Pitches outside the peak table (knuckleballs, eephus...) fall back to their own fx.
  parts  per peak, horizontal = how far it goes toward its side (Σ fx, zero if the peak
         sits the other way), vertical = how far it moves up OR down (|Σ fz|).
         Counting only drop, and leaving out pitches that rise above the four-seam, made
         a submariner's rising slider vanish from the map (Tyler Rogers: 24% of pitches).

Each part is summed over the pitcher's peaks and divided by ALL his pitches, so it reads
"inches per pitch thrown".
